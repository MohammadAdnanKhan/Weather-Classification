# Weather Classification

This Project explores a synthetic weather dataset designed for classifying tasks of weather types (Rainy, Sunny, Cloudy, Snowy). The data includes various weather-related features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover. We utilize three different classification models namely Support Vector Machine (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree, to predict the weather type based on these features.
